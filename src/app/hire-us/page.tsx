            Why Work With Philippine Strategies
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
            <strong>The Wagner name</strong>, for centuries associated with{" "}
            <strong>distinguished military service</strong> in Europe and the
            United States, has held noteworthy significance in the annals of
            Philippine history since the first family member,{" "}
            <strong>Capt. John A.</strong>, arrived in{" "}
            <strong>January of 1899</strong>.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
            For nearly half a century, from <strong>1899 to 1946</strong>, the
            majority of Americans in the Philippines were{" "}
            <strong>military males</strong> serving in the{" "}
            <strong>Army, Navy and Marines</strong>. After separation or
            retirement, many settled here with <strong>Filipina wives</strong>{" "}
            and their children, starting local businesses or working for the{" "}
            <strong>US government</strong> in a variety of service/support
            roles. By <strong>1941</strong>, nearly{" "}
            <strong>9,000 Americans</strong> called the Philippines home.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
            Rather than surrendering and being sent to prison camps, hundreds
            went <strong>underground</strong> and fought the{" "}
            <strong>Imperial Japanese</strong> with their Filipino brothers and
            sisters, whom they had known and grew up with since early childhood.
            These Americans, speaking fluent, inflectional{" "}
            <strong>Tagalog</strong>, <strong>Kapampangan</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>Cebuano</strong>, were considered{" "}
            <strong>“Kababayan”</strong> (Compatriots), just as much as their
            friends and neighbors with Malay or Aeta genetics. During the
            post-war decades, natural attrition and migration back to mainland
            America saw their numbers dwindle to under half the pre-war number,
            replenished only by military retirees from{" "}
            <strong>Subic Naval</strong> and <strong>Clark Air Force</strong>{" "}
            bases.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
            Some families, like the <strong>Wagner’s</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>Forbes’</strong>, <strong>Smiths</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>Laurents</strong>, maintained a presence on the islands into
            the modern era. For the most part engaged in{" "}
            <strong>charitable or philanthropic efforts</strong> to aid the
            peoples of the Philippines, they also provided and continue to
            effect services for <strong>American industry</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>US government</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>visiting military elements</strong> using their extensive
            familial contacts with <strong>local power centers</strong> garnered
            and developed over more than a century of relationships.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
            The <strong>business, diplomatic and political environments</strong>{" "}
            of this region are unique beyond measure in respects that shock even
            the loftiest of <strong>ambassadors, consuls</strong> or{" "}
            <strong>State Department officials</strong> who, living in the
            embassy bubble, will insist they came to understand the country and
            its peoples after only a typical <strong>3-year posting</strong>,
            ignoring wisdom and advice from the <strong>“Puting Maalam”</strong>{" "}
            (Old-timers / Wisemen) at their peril and frequent disgrace.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
            As <strong>Afghanistan</strong> was dubbed the “
            <strong>Graveyard of Empires</strong>” by Milton Bearden of Foreign
            Affairs magazine, the <strong>Philippines</strong> very easily fits
            into the “<strong>Caveat Emptor</strong>” classification of foreign
            investment and military alliances.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
            In multiple cases, the golden roads to success promised by Manila
            are littered with failed attempts of{" "}
            <strong>US, Canadian, Australian</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>European companies</strong> to prosper in special economic
            zones that ended up being scandal-ridden preserves of{" "}
            <strong>illegal Chinese online gambling</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>Korean money-laundering</strong>.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
            The <strong>US military</strong>, emboldened by the Benigno “
            <strong>Noynoy</strong>” Aquino III administration that enacted the{" "}
            <strong>Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA)</strong> in
            2014, was stymied just two years later when the xenophobic,
            pro-China <strong>Rodrigo Duterte</strong> ascended to the
            presidency.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
            Both situations cost{" "}
            <strong>hundreds of millions of dollars</strong> in wasted
            expenditures and <strong>8 years of time losses</strong>. Only those
            organizations who listened to the <strong>Puting Maalam</strong>{" "}
            were able to enjoy success during this period.

            When considering the Philippines, foreign investors, diplomatic
            planners and military strategists would be wise to heed the most
            famous quote attributed to Lieutenant-General Robert Stephenson
