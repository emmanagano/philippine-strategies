            friends and neighbors with Malay or Aeta genetics. During the
            post-war decades, natural attrition and migration back to mainland

            The Present Military Environment in the Philippines
          </h3>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            From 2016 to 2022, the administration of Rodrigo Duterte shifted
            away from the Philippines’ traditional ally, the United States, and
            toward China. The reasons behind this move were simple:
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            (1) He felt slighted and disrespected by Obama,
            <br />
            (2) China offered eyepopping amounts of money if he could keep US
            forces away from their artificial island building aka. stealth oil
            and gas fracking projects in the South China Sea,
            <br />
            (3) Denied a US Visa due to his human rights abuse record while
            Mayor of Davao City, he felt it was time to promulgate animosity
            toward Americans, Europeans and Australians – the “loathed whites” –
            in the minds of Filipinos to “free them of their colonial
            mentality”.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Ignoring warnings of duplicitousness on the part of the Chinese by
            other countries who had become their loan sharking victims, his plan
            worked well at first, hauling in boatloads of Yuan while gleefully
            denigrating foreigners in public, until July 2020 when he was
            unceremoniously left at the proverbial altar by Beijing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            His successor, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., known colloquially
            as “BBM”, immediately pivoted back to Washington after entering
            office in July of 2022, reinvigorating traditional ties through the
            establishment of a total of 9 US military sites under the EDCA
            (Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement) that was enacted by
            President Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III, Duterte’s immediate
            precursor.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Correcting the damage done to the original coalition that had been
            polluted with bribery and corruption among senior officers and
            officials by the Chinese continues to be a daunting task,
            particularly in view of increasing aggression by the PLAN (Peoples’
            Liberation Army Navy) against Philippine Navy + Coast Guard vessels
            and aircraft in the West Philippine Sea that had been enabled by the
            Duterte.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Beyond these challenges is the finding and deporting of an estimated
            4000 PLA personnel that had entered the country between 2017 to
            2022, embedded in “POGO’s” (Philippine Online Gaming Organizations)
            that Duterte had encouraged as revenue generators.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            To address the issue, BBM ordered a blanket ban on POGO’s in 2024
            that included a dragnet to round up Chinese who were in the country
            on sham spousal or retirement visas issued by corrupt former
            Duterte-era Bureau of Immigration (“BI”) managers.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            As of April 2025, no known POGO’s were in operation on Luzon or in
            the Visayas; most of them had either closed down or migrated south
            to Davao to enjoy protection under the Duterte family.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Cleaning these out poses additional challenges as age-old tribal
            animosities (Mindanaoans hold Tagalogs in disdain, etc.) intensify
            after the sudden, surprising arrest and extradition to the ICC
            (International Criminal Court) in The Hague of Duterte himself,
            allowing whatever PLA remnants yet exist within such organizations
            to operate freely, even in the open.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            American and allied government / military entities currently or
            considering working in the Philippines are advised to avail of
            information gathered through more than a century of in-country
            experience and local contact development.

            Foreign Investment in the Philippines
          </h3>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            When President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office in 2016, the
            Philippines entered an era marked by tough rhetoric, a controversial
            war on drugs, and a pivot towards China. But one of the less
            discussed — yet deeply consequential — impacts of his administration
            was the collapse of foreign direct investment (FDI), which the
            country still struggles to recover from nearly a decade later.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
            The Duterte Decline
          </h4>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            Despite campaign promises of economic growth and infrastructure
            overhaul, Duterte’s tenure saw FDI inflows drop dramatically.
            According to Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) data, net FDI inflows
            peaked in 2017 at $10.3 billion, only to begin a downward slide that
            was exacerbated by unpredictable policies, political volatility, and
            a growing perception that the Philippines was an increasingly risky
            place to do business.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Duterte’s open hostility to Western allies, cozying up to China
            without significant economic reciprocation, and the chilling effect
            of his aggressive domestic policies all contributed to investor
            hesitation. The business climate suffered from regulatory
            uncertainty, rule-of-law concerns, and a perception that the
            government was more interested in consolidating power than enabling
            business.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
            The Marcos-Duterte Conflict
          </h4>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            Upon entering the Palace in mid-2022, President Ferdinand “Bongbong”
            Marcos Jr. ushered in an era of cautious optimism that the country
            might reorient towards stability. But that hope was short-lived.
            What has emerged instead is an increasingly public power struggle
            between the Marcos and Duterte dynasties — two of the country’s most
            powerful political families, now locked in a bitter rivalry.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            This ongoing “clan war” has spilled over into public policy,
            appointments, and the security sector. For foreign investors, it
            signals a return to uncertainty. With key sectors of the bureaucracy
            and judiciary potentially influenced by partisan interests,
            long-term investment becomes harder to justify.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Notably, the rivalry hampers any serious push for reform of the
            industrial sector. Despite Marcos Jr.&apos;s stated goals of
            economic liberalization, the political capital needed to pursue
            meaningful changes is being squandered on factional battles. Many
            foreign investors already setup in country have complained bitterly
            about abuses heaped upon them by LCU’s (Local Government Units),
            contrary to national government promises.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
            The 60/40 Rule: A Relic That Still Repels
          </h4>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            One major, long-standing deterrent remains untouched: the 60/40 rule
            in the current Philippine Constitution, which limits foreign
            ownership of land and key industries to just 40%. While certain
            sectors like retail and renewable energy have seen incremental
            liberalization, the core restriction on equity remains.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Foreign firms continue to view this as a dealbreaker, particularly
            when neighboring countries like Vietnam and Indonesia offer more
            favorable terms. Without constitutional reform — a political hot
            potato that Marcos has effectively championed yet — the Philippines
            will remain a secondary choice for serious foreign capital.

            The CREATE Law: A Broken Promise
          </h4>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            Adding salt to the wound, the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives
            for Enterprises (CREATE) law, passed during the Duterte
            administration and implemented under Marcos Jr., has caused
            widespread disillusionment among foreign investors — especially
            those operating in freeport zones like Clark and Subic.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            While touted as a way to rationalize tax incentives and attract more
            business, the CREATE law did the opposite for many Locators. It
            retroactively changed the terms of their tax holidays and
            incentives, undermining trust and violating long-standing
            agreements. Many companies that had sunk millions into facilities
            based on specific tax regimes suddenly found themselves in a new,
            less favorable playing field.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            This reversal has led to legal disputes and, in some cases, outright
            withdrawal of investments. For foreign investors, the message was
            clear: even government assurances in the Philippines can be subject
            to abrupt political change.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Bottom Line</h4>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            The Philippines once held the promise of becoming Southeast Asia’s
            rising economic tiger, but the past decade has turned that narrative
            into a cautionary tale. FDI remains sluggish, and despite official
            optimism, the numbers don’t lie. Political infighting, outdated
            ownership laws, and broken promises have left the country at a
            standstill.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Until real reform — political, economic, and institutional — is
            undertaken, foreign investors will continue to look elsewhere. And
            unless the Marcos and Duterte camps find a way to end their zero-sum
            war, the Philippines risks becoming a footnote in the regional
            economic story rather than a protagonist.

            involving foreign nationals. In October 2024, an American YouTuber
            named Elliot Onil Eastman was kidnapped in Sibuco, Zamboanga del
            Norte. He was reportedly shot while resisting abduction and later
            died from his injuries, the body allegedly disposed of at sea. This
            and other such events not reported by the local press to obfuscate
            negative publicity underscore the persistent security concerns in
            the region.

            The political turbulence stemming from Vice President Duterte&apos;s
            impeachment could exacerbate these security issues. Analysts suggest
            that while domestic events like impeachment proceedings are internal
            matters, they can have ripple effects on foreign relations and
            damage perceptions of stability. Josue Raphael Cortez, a lecturer at
            the School of Diplomacy and Governance at De La Salle-College of St.
            Benilde in Manila, noted that such proceedings might impact foreign
            relations by influencing international assessments of the
            Philippines&apos; already abysmal commitment to the rule of law.

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Furthermore, the geopolitical landscape in the region is complex.
            China has expressed concerns over U.S. military deployments in the
            Philippines, stating that such actions undermine regional peace and
            stability. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi highlighted these
            apprehensions in discussions with South Korean officials,
            emphasizing the need to avoid escalating tensions. Yi also slammed
            the planned sale of American F-16’s as the Philippines attempting to
            cause trouble in the region.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Given these dynamics, American diplomats and government officials
            operating in the Philippines may face increased difficulties as
            political instability can embolden insurgent groups or criminal
            elements, some of which are in fact sanctioned by or proxies for
            LGU’s (“Local Government Units”), potentially leading to increased
            threats against foreign nationals. Uncertainty in local governance
            may also disrupt diplomatic initiatives, aid programs, and
            collaborative projects in the region. Additionally, navigating
            relationships with local and national authorities could become more
            complex amid shifting political alliances and public sentiments,
            especially in view of press propaganda that tends to blame the US
            for much of what is ailing the country.

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
            While the impeachment of Vice President Sara Duterte is a matter for
            Filipinos to work through, its ramifications could extend to the
            operational environment for American diplomats and officials
            throughout the country. Proactive measures, including enhanced
            security protocols and continuous assessment of the local political
            climate, will be essential to mitigate potential challenges in this
            evolving landscape.
