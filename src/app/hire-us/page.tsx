          Hire Us – Strategic Advisory for the Philippines

          For over a century, the Wagner name has been synonymous with deep,
          on-the-ground expertise in the Philippines. Our legacy began in 1899
          with Captain John A. Wagner of the 31st US Infantry Regiment, and has
          since evolved into a multi-generational presence offering unmatched
          local insight to foreign investors, diplomats, and military planners
          alike.

          Why Choose Philippine Strategies?
        </h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 text-base">
          <li>
            <strong>Embedded Expertise in a Complex Environment:</strong> The
            Philippine political, military, and economic systems are intricate
            and often unpredictable. Many foreign entities underestimate the
            depth of cultural, tribal, and bureaucratic nuance involved. We
            don&apos;t. Philippine Strategies has cultivated personal
            relationships and institutional knowledge through decades of
            immersion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Military and Diplomatic Acumen:</strong> From Duterte&apos;s
            pivot to China and the fallout of abandoned alliances, to BBM&apos;s
            recalibration toward the US under EDCA, we understand the shifting
            military and geopolitical terrain. We help clients navigate these
            dynamics with clarity and foresight.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Investment Navigation in a Risk-Laden Landscape:</strong>{" "}
            Foreign Direct Investment in the Philippines is fraught with
            outdated restrictions, regulatory reversals, and local-level
            interference. We&apos;ve advised clients through the 60/40
            constitutional rule, CREATE law instability, and economic zone
            mismanagement. We offer strategies that mitigate risk and maximize
            your foothold.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proven Track Record and Reputation:</strong> As former
            President Fidel V. Ramos once remarked, “No one from the US knows
            this country better than the Wagner family.” Our legacy is backed by
            real results, trusted relationships, and repeat engagements with
            government officials and private entities alike.

          A Word of Caution – and Opportunity
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Philippines is not a market you can simply &quot;enter.&quot; It
          is a country that must be understood. We’ve seen embassies,
          multinational corporations, and military units lose time and money by
          ignoring the value of local intelligence.
