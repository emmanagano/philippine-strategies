		"commentary":"First-hand accounts from foreign executives in China reveal how the country‚Äôs trajectory shifted from open curiosity to calculated competition. What began in the early 2000s as polite engagement and knowledge exchange evolved into widespread intellectual property theft, aggressive deal manipulation, and a systemic willingness to cut corners‚Äîeven in life-and-death matters like infant formula safety. These experiences underscore a deeper concern: when a society‚Äôs moral framework is stripped away and replaced solely with the pursuit of power and success, the rules become whatever serves the end goal. China‚Äôs rise is not just an economic story‚Äîit‚Äôs a warning about what happens when ambition is untethered from ethics."

		"commentary": "This powerful short doc follows Frenchie, a foreign content creator, as he traces the life cycle of Pagpag ‚Äî recycled fast food collected from Jollibee and McDonald‚Äôs trash bins, washed, cooked, and resold in the slums of Tondo, Manila. From speaking with street vendors to riding garbage trucks into ‚ÄúHappyland,‚Äù he uncovers how poverty forces thousands to survive on what others throw away. Both heartbreaking and deeply human, this video sheds light on the invisible food chain feeding the city‚Äôs poorest ‚Äî and the dignity they maintain despite it."

		"commentary": "Fake accounts, real damage. The pro-Duterte noise machine isn't grassroots ‚Äî it‚Äôs a ghost army. AI now confirms what many suspected: a deliberate network of bots flooding social media to rewrite the narrative, paint Duterte as the victim, and manipulate midterm election discourse. The Philippines has become the testing ground for digital black ops. If we don‚Äôt wise up, we‚Äôll keep voting in shadows, not leaders."
