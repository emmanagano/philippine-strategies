		"commentary": "This powerful short doc follows Frenchie, a foreign content creator, as he traces the life cycle of Pagpag ‚Äî recycled fast food collected from Jollibee and McDonald‚Äôs trash bins, washed, cooked, and resold in the slums of Tondo, Manila. From speaking with street vendors to riding garbage trucks into ‚ÄúHappyland,‚Äù he uncovers how poverty forces thousands to survive on what others throw away. Both heartbreaking and deeply human, this video sheds light on the invisible food chain feeding the city‚Äôs poorest ‚Äî and the dignity they maintain despite it."

		"commentary": "Fake accounts, real damage. The pro-Duterte noise machine isn't grassroots ‚Äî it‚Äôs a ghost army. AI now confirms what many suspected: a deliberate network of bots flooding social media to rewrite the narrative, paint Duterte as the victim, and manipulate midterm election discourse. The Philippines has become the testing ground for digital black ops. If we don‚Äôt wise up, we‚Äôll keep voting in shadows, not leaders."

While Singapore enforced discipline, the Philippines let clowns and crooks recycle power. We were ahead of South Korea once. Now we export our best people and re-elect our worst. His warning wasn‚Äôt prophecy. It was common sense. We just refused to listen. Click the discover button to watch the full video. üëá"
